# Math Gesture Recognition and Solver

## Overview

This project uses a combination of computer vision and AI to recognize hand gestures made in front of a webcam and solve mathematical problems based on those gestures. It integrates OpenCV for hand tracking, a generative AI model for solving math problems, and Streamlit for the user interface.

## Features

- Hand gesture recognition to capture math problems.
- Real-time drawing on the canvas based on detected gestures.
- Integration with a generative AI model to solve math problems.
- Display of solved problems in a web interface.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MathGestureRecognition.git
   cd MathGestureRecognition
